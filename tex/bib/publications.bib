  abstract = {Abstract In this paper, we provide an algorithm to estimate from below the dimension of self-similar measures with overlaps. As an application, we show that for any β∈(1,2)\$ \beta \in (1,2)\$, the dimension of the Bernoulli convolution μβ\$ \mu \_{\beta }\$ satisfies dim(μβ)⩾0.98040856,\begin{equation*}\hskip7pc \dim (\mu \_{\beta })\geqslant 0.98040856,\hskip-7pc\vspace*{-6pt} \end{equation*}which improves a previous uniform lower bound 0.82 obtained by Hare and Sidorov (Exp. Math. 27 (2018), no. 4, 414–418). This new uniform lower bound is very close to the known numerical approximation 0.98040931953±10−11\$ 0.98040931953\pm 10^{-11}\$ for dimμβ3\$\dim \mu \_{\beta \_3}\$, where β3≈1.839286755214161\$ \beta \_{3} \approx 1.839286755214161\$ is the largest root of the polynomial x3−x2−x−1\$ x^{3}-x^{2}-x-1\$. Moreover, the infimum infβ∈(1,2)dim(μβ)\$\inf \_{\beta \in (1,2)}\dim (\mu \_{\beta })\$ is attained at a parameter β∗\$\beta \_*\$ in a small interval (β3−10−8,β3+10−8).\begin{equation*}\hskip7pc (\beta \_{3} -10^{-8}, \beta \_{3} + 10^{-8}).\hskip-7pc \end{equation*}When β\$\beta\$ is a Pisot number, we express dim(μβ)\$\dim (\mu \_{\beta })\$ in terms of the measure-theoretic entropy of the equilibrium measure for certain matrix pressure function, and present an algorithm to estimate dim(μβ)\$\dim (\mu \_\beta )\$ from above as well.},
