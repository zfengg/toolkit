## Why not immigrate this directory to a new Repo?
This directory is a part of a greater toolkit. We want to reduce the redundancy and make it easier to update for personal use. Some daily usage commands like `cpinputgrades` depends on this directory. A clearer documentation for the whole repo might be given in the future if time available.
